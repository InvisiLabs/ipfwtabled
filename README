DESCRIPTION

  IPFWTABLED is a daemon for FreeBSD OS which is intended to provide remote
  interface to IPFW's (FreeBSD firewall) tables. This might be useful for
  environments which use ipfw tables intensively (to prevent fork-bombing with
  'ipfw' command) or want to control firewall remotely.

USAGE
  
  ipfwtabled [-h <host>[:<port>][ -h <host>[:<port>] ...]]
             [-d] [-v <verbosity>] [-t|-u]
   -b <host>:<port> - address to bind to. May be specified multiple times. If no
                      option specified, daemon bounds to all local addresses.
   -d               - fork to background and become daemon.
   -t               - use connection-based sockets (SOCK_STREAM)
   -u               - use connection-less sockets (SOCK_DGRAM)
   -h               - print this message

  See example Perl 'client.pl' for reference on client implementation.

INSTALLATION

  Source comes with simple Makefile thus plain

    $ make

  should be enough.

COMPATIBILITY

  Tested on FreeBSD 9 but should work on earlier versions as well.

SOURCE
  
  Source is available on github: https://github.com/InvisiLabs/ipfwtabled

TODO

  * Add rcNG script for automatic service startup
  * Add hash field for authentication/integrity check purposes

BUGS

  Please, report bugs and suggestions to <v.khondar at invisilabs.com> or via
  github issue tracker at https://github.com/InvisiLabs/ipfwtabled/issues

LIMITATIONS

  Currently, only ADD/DELETE/FLUSH operations for IPFW tables are supported.
  Single address in CIDR notation is processed per single request.

  IPFWTABLED must be run as root as interation with IPFW is performed via
  setsockopt() interface which requires root privileges.
